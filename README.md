# Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for javascript apps.
<br/>
Manage the state of your application in a predictable way, redux can help you.

#### Three Core Concepts:
- A store that holds the state of your application.
- An action that describes the changes in the state of the application.
- A reducer which actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

#### Three Principles
##### First Principle
"The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store"<br/>
Maintain our application state in a single object which would be managed by the Redux store<br/>
<br/>

##### Second Principle
"The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened" <br/>
To update the state of your app, you need to let Redux know about that with an action Not allowed to directly update the state object<br/>
<br/>

##### Third Principle
"To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers" <br/>
Reducer - (previousState, action) => newstate<br/>
<br/>
